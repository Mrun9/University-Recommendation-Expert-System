The process of selecting appropriate universities for higher studies, especially in fields like Computer Science, can be overwhelming for students. They need to evaluate various factors such as GRE score, GPA, work experience, and research background to determine which universities they should apply to. Without proper guidance, students may waste time applying to too many or too few universities, and they may miss out on the best opportunities.

This project aims to address the problem by implementing a university recommendation expert system that helps students categorize universities into Safe, Target, and Ambitious options based on their academic profile. The system leverages Prolog to represent expert knowledge and reason about the best universities based on various inputs.
